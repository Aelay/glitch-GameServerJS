## What you'll find in here: ##

Glitch's gameplay was driven entirely by server-side JavaScript running on top
of Rhino (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino</a>). This repository contains all of that
JavaScript. You'll also find every bit of dialogue in here. If you were ever 
wondering how to get a super-rare achievement, you'll find that in here as 
well.
